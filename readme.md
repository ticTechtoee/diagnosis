# **AI-Powered Medical Diagnostic Tool** ü©∫
**Detect Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Lung Cancer using Machine Learning and Medical Imaging**

## üöÄ **Overview**
This project implements an AI-driven diagnostic application capable of detecting:
- **Pneumonia** and **COVID-19** from Chest X-Rays
- **Lung Cancer** from Chest CT Scans

The application combines a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification with a web interface built using Django, providing an accessible and user-friendly diagnostic solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

### **Machine Learning**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for model building and training
- **NumPy**: Efficient array manipulation and computations

### **Web Development**
- **Django**: Python-based backend web framework
- **Bootstrap**: Front-end framework for responsive UI design

### **Data Preprocessing**
- **OpenCV**: Image processing for grayscale conversion, resizing, and enhancements
- **Sklearn**: For data splitting (train-test split)

---

## üß™ **How It Works**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
The `preprocess.py` script:
- Loads X-Ray or CT Scan images from the dataset directory.
- Converts images to grayscale and resizes them to **224x224 pixels**.
- Normalizes pixel values to the range [0, 1].
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.

```bash
# Run preprocessing to prepare the dataset
python preprocess.py
```

### **2. Model Training**
The `build_model.py` script trains a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for multi-class classification:
- 3 Classes for Pneumonia/COVID Detection: `COVID`, `Non-COVID`, and `Pneumonia`
- 2 Classes for Lung Cancer Detection: `Lung Cancer` and `Normal`

Training features include:
- **3 Convolutional Layers** with ReLU activation
- **MaxPooling** for dimensionality reduction
- **Dropout** to avoid overfitting
- **Softmax** activation for multi-class outputs

```bash
# Train the machine learning model
python build_model.py
```

### **3. Disease Detection via Web Application**
The `detect.py` file integrates the trained models into a Django web application.
- Upload chest X-Ray/CT images through the frontend.
- Process the uploaded image and predict results using the model.
- Return diagnosis (e.g., COVID, Pneumonia, or Lung Cancer) with status updates.

**Sample Workflow**:
1. Upload an image (`.jpg` or `.png`)
2. Process the image with the selected ML model.
3. Display prediction results on the UI.

---

## üåü **Features**
- **Multiple Disease Detection**: Predict COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Lung Cancer.
- **Responsive Web UI**: Built with Django and Bootstrap for usability.
- **Fast and Accurate Predictions**: Achieved with optimized CNN models.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Automatic image resizing and normalization for consistent results.
